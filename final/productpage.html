    <p class="product-short-des">Better steering, better refinement, better safety, more modern lighting. All of them
      steps ahead from a car that already pretty much led the class. Get yourself a 148bhp TSi with the multi-link axle
      and you’re laughing.
      Oh and by the way, for the next few years, VW doesn’t even see Golf sales falling away. Early orders suggest ID.3
      buyers will come from other places, while yesterday’s Golf buyers stick to today’s Golf. They won’t go far wrong.
